## Predict-the-strength-of-a-Password
  In this project, we developed a sophisticated machine learning model designed to evaluate and categorize passwords into one of three levels: Strong, Good, or Weak. The model leverages an array of features, including password length, character diversity, and complexity, to assess and classify password strength accurately. By employing advanced algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, we aimed to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy and reliability. The classification system provides users with immediate, actionable feedback, promoting the adoption of stronger passwords and improving overall security. This project not only addresses the need for better password practices but also contributes to advancing cybersecurity measures through data-driven insights.
